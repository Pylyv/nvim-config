My personal NVIM configuration and set up

Hello everyone.

This repo is made just to track the progress of the **from O to God mode** creating and configuring from scratch
my own `vim/nvim` set up.

This allows me to keep tracked the changes I introduce over the time, see how my personal configuration evolves over the time and share it with anyone instested while I am able to make some sort of tutorial while I am writing it.

Also, this allows me to have a reference point whenever I got into a new computer or set up, so I can quickly just `git clone` this repository and start to work inmmediatly.

DIFFERENT OS

I mostly do my coding personal job on `Linux` and `Windows` (like 70% - 30%) and my professional paid job the other way around, `Windows` and `Linux` (like 85% - 15%), and I use `Linux` mostly though `WSL`.

So you won't find any interesting here about `Mac`

For `Unix` users, vim already comes by default on most of the modern distros. And `nvim` is an easy to get one.
But `Windows` is a different kind of thing. You'll need to do some job to get your `nvim` working fine or it, so I'll let you [here](TODO link to the medium guide) a nice guide of how to get and install it on `Windows`.
